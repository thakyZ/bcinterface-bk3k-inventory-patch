# BCInterface - Bk3k's Inventory Patch

**Re-skins the bk3k's Inventory.**

Required items are required, as the game will most likely crash otherwise.   
Will not work with any other re-skins of bk3k's inventory.

Credit to [GoodGuy](https://steamcommunity.com/id/goodguyn1ck) for making the base mod and the base assets.
Credit to [bk3k](https://steamcommunity.com/id/bk3000) for his inventory revamp.

I would recommend using this mod with the main BCInterface mod.

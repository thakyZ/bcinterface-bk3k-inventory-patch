^#EA9931;Re-skins the bk3k's Inventory.^#FFFFFF;

Required items are required, as the game will most likely crash otherwise.
Will not work with any other re-skins of bk3k's inventory.

Credit to ^#5588D4;GoodGuy^#FFFFFF; for making the base mod and the base assets.
Credit to ^#5588D4;bk3k^#FFFFFF; for his inventory revamp.

I would recommend using this mod with the main BCInterface mod.
